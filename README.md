# The Effect of Noise on Knowledge Graph Embeddings

These are the resources for my Bachelor Thesis. Under [config files](https://github.com/VR10/kgenoise/tree/master/config%20files) is the folder structure used for training containing the datasets and config files.
[noise generation](https://github.com/VR10/kgenoise/tree/master/noise_generation) contains the scripts used for generating the noisy datasets as well as a visualiziation of how the scripts operate.
[results](https://github.com/VR10/kgenoise/tree/master/results) contains CSV and Excel files with all the test results. The Excel files also contain the graphs used in the Thesis. The [code summary](https://github.com/VR10/kgenoise/blob/master/code_summary.ipynb) notebook contains the training code as well as other code I used for the Thesis.
